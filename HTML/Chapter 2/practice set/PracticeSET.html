A century after Damon and Stefan leave Mystic Falls, they both return and meet Elena Gilbert (also Nina Dobrev), a mortal who looks exactly like Katherine. Damon wants to ‘win’ Elena away from Stefan, but she chooses Stefan over Damon, then Elena later breaks up with Stefan after she develops feelings for Damon.</p>

    <h3>Telivision series</h3>
    <hr>
    
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <hr>
    
    <p>Damon Salvatore is a vampire, turned by Katherine Pierce 145 years prior to the series' debut. He is the son of late Giuseppe Salvatore, ripper Lily Salvatore and older brother of Stefan Salvatore. Damon is portrayed as charming but cruel, taking pleasure in killing and feeding on humans, while Stefan satisfies his vampiric hunger by feeding on animals.</p>
    <h5>SEASON 1</h5>
    <hr>
    
    <p>In the first season, Damon appears as the older brother of Stefan Salvatore, and plays the main antagonist.[4] He has brief moments of compassion, however, such as erasing Jeremy Gilbert's memory of vampires and removing his "suffering"[4] so Jeremy can get his life back on track.[5] Damon apologizes for turning Vicki Donovan into a vampire and admits it was wrong.[6] Damon admits to Elena that he came to the town wanting to destroy it but actually found himself wanting to protect it. The two begin to kiss passionately before getting interrupted - it is later revealed that it was not Elena he kissed, but Katherine Pierce.[6] Later in the season, it is also implied that he actually feels human emotions, such as pain and love.</p>
    <h5>SEASON 2</h5>
    <hr>
    
    <p>In season two, both Katherine and Elena tell Damon that they love Stefan, not him. As an expression of his anger, pain, and hopelessness, he snaps Jeremy Gilbert's neck, not realizing he is wearing a ring that reverses the damage done by supernatural creatures or forces. Jeremy survives because of the ring, but Damon's action incurs Elena's wrath and pain. When Bonnie also discovers it was his blood that enabled Caroline Forbes to become a vampire, the two declare their hatred for him, leaving angrier than ever.[7] After saving Elena with Stefan in episode 8 of season 2, Damon shows up in Elena's room with the vervain necklace that was ripped from her neck earlier in the episode. Before he gives it back, he tells Elena that he is in love with her, and because he is in love with her, he cannot be selfish with her. He also states that he does not deserve her, but that his brother does. He kisses her forehead and says he wishes she could remember this, but she cannot. Elena blinks and her vervain necklace is back around her neck, Damon is gone and her window is open with the curtains blowing. She had no recollection as to how the necklace was returned to her.

        In one episode, Damon joins Rose to find out why the originals are after Elena; after some time and clever banter, the two have sex, stating that they could rid themselves of emotion. However, when Rose, Damon's old friend, is mortally bitten by a werewolf, he gives her the memory of her life prior to becoming a vampire and helps her remember how good it felt to be able to walk and feel the sunlight, without it burning her. Damon puts her out of her misery, leaving him to mourn the death of his one of few real friends. Elena and Damon then begin to mend fences, and Elena gives him an affectionate hug to help comfort him after Rose's death. Damon begins showing another side of himself in small acts that help build what once was an impossible friendship between Elena and himself after she clearly stated that he has lost her forever. After he spares Caroline's mother, Elena says how that was the person she was once friends with. It is hard for Damon to accept that he has to change to have her in his life, which he explains to Andy Star, his compelled girlfriend a few more episodes in. Damon is bitten by Tyler the werewolf at the end of the season. Elena takes care of him, and right before he is cured by the blood of Klaus, the original hybrid, she gives him a "goodbye" kiss, because she is sure he is going to die. She forgives him, telling him that she cares for him through grief-stricken tears.</p>
